# Problem Resolution and Next Steps(2024/11/25)

## Problem Resolution

### Overview

This document describes the process undertaken to resolve issues in the Go-based Carbon Trading Backend project. The issues were identified in the `controllers`, `handlers`, `middleware`, and `main.go` files, as well as in their integration.

---

### Steps to Solve the Issues

#### 1. `auth_controller.go` in `controllers`

- **Problem**: Import paths for `models` and `utils` were broken.
- **Resolution**: Updated the import paths to match the `go.mod` module path. Example:
  ```go
  import (
      "github.com/dennislee928/Carbon_Trading_For_Individuals_Frontend/backend/models"
      "github.com/dennislee928/Carbon_Trading_For_Individuals_Frontend/backend/utils"
  )
  ```
- Enhanced error handling and added detailed logging for registration, login, and OTP verification.

#### 2. `auth.go` in `middleware`

- **Problem**: Misplaced handler functions (`Register`, `VerifyOTP`, etc.) and missing middleware logic.
- **Resolution**:
  - Moved misplaced functions to `controllers/auth_controller.go`.
  - Retained only middleware-specific logic, such as `AuthMiddleware`.

#### 3. `handlers` Package

- **Problem**: Missing or improperly defined functions (`Home`, `RegisterUser`).
- **Resolution**:
  - Implemented `Home` in `handlers/handlers.go` with the correct Gin handler signature:
    ```go
    func Home(c *gin.Context) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"message": "Welcome to Carbon Rights Backend API"})
    }
    ```
  - Forwarded `RegisterUser` to the corresponding function in `controllers`.

#### 4. `main.go`

- **Problem**: Mismatched handler function signatures and missing arguments.
- **Resolution**:
  - Fixed route setup to correctly match Gin's expected handler signature using inline functions where necessary. Example:
    ```go
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        handlers.Home(c)
    })
    ```
  - Integrated middleware and database dependency injection into routes.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - Conduct unit tests for all functions in `controllers`, `handlers`, and `middleware`.
   - Use tools like Postman or cURL to validate the `/register`, `/login`, and `/` endpoints.

2. **Database Schema Validation**:

   - Verify the database schema aligns with the queries in `models`.

3. **Add Logging and Monitoring**:

   - Use a logging library like `zap` or `logrus` for structured logging.
   - Integrate monitoring for API usage and error tracking.

4. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Replace the placeholder secret key in `AuthMiddleware` with a securely stored value.
   - Use an environment variable manager like `dotenv` for secret management.

5. **Code Optimization**:

   - Refactor shared utility functions (e.g., `GenerateJWT`) into a common `utils` package.

6. **Documentation**:

   - Document the API endpoints and expected request/response payloads using Swagger/OpenAPI.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on a platform like Heroku or AWS and test in a staging environment.
